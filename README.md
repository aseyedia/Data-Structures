# EN.605.202.81.FA18 Data Structures
## FALL18 Data Structures course at Johns Hopkins University

    These are the labs that I have completed for this data structures prerequisite course for M.S. in Bioinformatics. Each one of the lab directories have the lab requirements, the class files (including the main class), documentation and my require analysis. Also included is the `Intro to Java Formatting.xml` file, which is a code formatting style that was required for a previous course by the same name that I used as part of the coding requirements for this class as well.
    
### Requirements

* Java Development Kit 1.8
