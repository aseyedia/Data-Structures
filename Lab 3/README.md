# Lab 3 - Cycles of Graph with Pointers
This project was created for the EN.605.202.81.FA18 Data Structures class taken at Johns Hopkins University.

## Overview
This program is a spin on the previous lab, which takes a binary matrix of i * i dimensions and processes it as a graph in row-major order, with each row representing a vertex. However, the edges between the vertices in the graph have to be implemented as a linked structure. The program then traverses the vertices as a tree in a depth-first manner and prints out all possible paths. 

## Requirements
- Java version 7 or 8
- JDK 1.7 or 1.8
- IDE, either IntelliJ or Eclipse preferred
