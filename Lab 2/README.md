# Lab 2 - Cycles of Graph

This project was created for the EN.605.202.81.FA18 Data Structures class taken at Johns Hopkins University.

## Overview

This program takes a binary matrix of ixi dimensions and processes it as a graph in row-major order, with each row representing a vertex. The program then traverses the vertices as a tree in a depth-first manner and prints out all possible paths. 

## Requirements

- Java version 7 or 8
- JDK 1.7 or 1,8
- IDE, either IntelliJ or Eclipse preferred

## Documentation

Refer to javadocs, in the doc folder for more information.
