# Elevator Simulation using Stacks

This project was created for the EN.605.202.81.FA18 Data Structures class taken at Johns Hopkins University.

## Overview

This is an elevator simulation program which uses stacks to load and unload passengers. `elevator input data.txt` is the course-provided text input file which contains the names of the passengers, as well as the floor they enter and the floor they exit the elevator. `eleva_output.txt` is the corresponding output file. Part of the assignment was to create an input file using unique passengers to test the simulation on another, random input. This input file is titled `user input data.txt` and its corresponding output file is named `user_output.txt`.

## Requirements
